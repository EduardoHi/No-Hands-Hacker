# No Hands Hacker

This application is a solution for people who have a certain physical limitation in their hands or fingers, but would like to program just like any other hacker. You might think that there are more than enough programming tools for everyone, but think about how you would make your current project or homework, if you could not type whatsoever.


## Instructions
### Development server

  Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

  Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

### Build

  Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
